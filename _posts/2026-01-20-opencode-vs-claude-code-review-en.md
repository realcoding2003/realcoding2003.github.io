# I Tried Opencode

## Yet Another AI Coding Tool

Opencode kept popping up in developer communities, so I gave it a try.

It's a terminal-based AI coding tool, and it's open source. Built in Go, so it's lightweight and easy to install. It supports multiple models including Anthropic and OpenAI.

First impression was positive. The terminal UI is clean and responsive.

## How Does It Compare to Claude Code?

But the more I used it, the more I realized Claude Code already does all of this.

File read/write, terminal command execution, project context understanding, multi-file editing. The core features are essentially the same.

Opencode's advantages:
- Open source, so you can customize it
- Freedom to choose between multiple LLM providers
- Go binary means lightweight installation

Claude Code's advantages:
- Built by Anthropic, so optimization with Claude models is unmatched
- Ecosystem already well-established with MCP server integration, project memory, etc.
- Agent mode is highly polished
- Great IDE integration with VSCode extensions

## The Verdict: "I'm Already Happy"

Like I felt after [using Cursor for a month](/2025/03/20/cursor-agent-one-month-review-en/), AI coding tools are evolving at a breathtaking pace. There's always a temptation to try every new tool that comes out, but realistically, getting comfortable with one tool is better for productivity.

Opencode is a solid project. It's a great choice for people who don't want to be locked into a specific LLM. But for someone like me who already uses Claude Code as their primary tool, there wasn't a compelling reason to switch.

The power of open source is real, though. If Opencode introduces a great feature, Claude Code will likely add something similar, and vice versa. Competition benefits users in the end.

One thing that does bother me is the [growing stack of AI tool subscriptions](/2026/02/05/ai-subscription-regret-en/). If open source alternatives keep maturing, that could open up more options on the cost front too.
