# The Annual AI Subscription Trap

## Annual Plans Look Like Such a Good Deal

If you're a developer, you're probably paying for at least one AI tool.

Same here. But my mistake was pulling the trigger on annual plans too easily.

"Save 40% compared to monthly!" That pitch got me every time. Cursor, AI image generation tools, code review tools, miscellaneous SaaS products. The total... I'd rather not think about it.

## The Landscape Shifts in Months

I massively underestimated how fast the AI market moves.

About 3 months after signing an annual plan, a better alternative shows up. At the 6-month mark, the service itself might become irrelevant. I signed up for SkyWork annually, and a few months later a different service blew past it. Same story with ready.ai.

My [one-month Cursor review](/en/2025/03/20/cursor-agent-one-month-review-en/) was written in this exact context. Tools change so rapidly that long-term commitments become a liability.

## My New Rules

After getting burned a few times, I established some personal rules.

**Monthly billing only for AI tools**. No matter how good the annual discount looks. There's zero guarantee you'll still be using that tool in 3 months.

**Use the entire free trial**. Don't pay on first impression. Use it for at least 2 weeks before deciding.

**Keep only one core paid tool**. With [local options like Ollama](/en/2025/02/15/ollama-local-llm-review-en/) available, limit paid subscriptions to what's truly essential.

**Audit subscriptions quarterly**. If you're not using something, cancel immediately. Procrastination is just money leaking out.

## This Isn't Just an AI Problem

Subscription hell existed long before AI. But the AI space moves so fast that the risk of annual commitments is significantly higher.

Traditional SaaS doesn't change drastically in 1-2 years. Notion isn't going to disappear overnight. But AI tools can genuinely have their market flipped upside down within six months.

The takeaway? Monthly billing for AI subscriptions. That's the rule. Don't let annual discounts tempt you. Though I'll probably still waver the next time I see "50% off"...
