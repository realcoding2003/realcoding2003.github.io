# AI Development Reality Check: Lessons from Blog Automation

![AI Development Reality](/assets/images/posts/ai-dev-reality-diary/hero.png)
*The reality of AI development: coexistence of convenience and complexity*

## 📝 Today's Problem

For the past few days, I've been completely immersed in creating a GitHub Pages blog and working on AI prompt automation.

Since AI was generating code so smoothly, I thought "Wow, this is really easy!" But when I actually tried to run it, problems kept popping up everywhere.

## 💡 Problem-Solving Process

### AI's Strengths: Rapid Prototyping

```yaml
# Jekyll configuration generated by AI in 1 minute
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-sitemap
  - jekyll-seo-tag

collections:
  posts:
    output: true
    permalink: /:year/:month/:day/:title/
```

**What was great**: AI creates basic structures and templates really quickly

### AI's Limitations: Detailed Debugging

```bash
# In reality, these errors kept occurring
Error: Liquid syntax error: Unknown tag 'mermaid'
Error: Github Pages build failed
```

**The problem**: When AI-generated code doesn't work in the actual environment, finding what went wrong is ultimately the developer's responsibility

## 🎯 Key Insights

### 1. AI + Existing Knowledge: An Essential Combination

- AI generates code, but **guiding it in the right direction** is the developer's role
- Existing knowledge to **validate and modify** the generated output is essential

### 2. The New Dilemma for Junior Developers

```javascript
// Old junior developer's goal
const juniorGoal = "Step by step from Hello World";

// Current junior developer's reality
const currentReality = "This much with AI should be basic, right?";
```

**Paradoxical situation**: 

- Learning has become easier, but expectations have risen to 5-6 years of experience level
- AI tool utilization skills are now additionally required

### 3. Core Skills in AI Development

- **Prompt Engineering**: Accurately conveying requirements to AI
- **Output Validation**: Identifying problems in generated code
- **Iterative Improvement**: Progressively enhancing quality together with AI

## 📈 Conclusion

AI development is **an innovation in tools**, not **a replacement for development knowledge**.

In fact, you need existing development knowledge to properly utilize AI and to judge "this isn't right" when AI makes mistakes.

**Essential competencies for new developers**:

- Traditional development knowledge (fundamentals)
- AI tool utilization skills (new fundamentals)
- Insight to connect these two domains

It's quite ironic, but this is reality. Developers in the AI era need to know even more.
