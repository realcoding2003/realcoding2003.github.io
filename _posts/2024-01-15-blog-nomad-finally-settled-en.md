# The Blog Nomad Finally Settles Down

## A History of Wandering

I didn't expect running a single blog to be this hard.

Looking back, the number of blog platforms I've been through is embarrassing.

**Naver Blog** — Where it all started. Accessible, but code block support was terrible. You can't write dev content without proper code formatting. The frustration drove me out.

**Tistory** — Moved for the free skin customization. Markdown support was decent. But after Kakao acquired it, things felt unstable. Policies kept changing, and depending on a platform for my own content felt wrong.

**WordPress** — Self-hosted means full ownership, so I switched. The plugin ecosystem is incredible, but update management is a pain. Plugin conflicts crash the site, skip security patches and you get hacked. I came to write blog posts but ended up managing a server.

**GitHub Pages** — Jekyll-based static site. Write in Markdown, git push, done. No server management, free, full ownership. Initial setup was a bit tedious though, and the entry barrier for non-developers is high.

## Why All the Moving?

Each migration had its reasons. But honestly, looking back, they were closer to excuses.

The real reason is simple: **when you're not writing, you blame the platform.**

"The code blocks look ugly here." "Loading is slow." "SEO is bad." Switching blog platforms is like giving yourself a pass for not writing. Moving feels like a fresh start. But you move and still don't write.

It's the same as buying workout clothes to start a diet.

## This Time Is Different

I've settled on GitHub Pages + Jekyll.

The reasons are straightforward:

- Write in Markdown — the most natural format for developers
- Managed with git — version control built in
- No hosting costs — free
- Custom domain support — looks professional
- No platform lock-in — Markdown files can go anywhere

The most important thing: writing a blog post follows the same workflow as writing code. Open editor, write Markdown, git commit, push. It feels natural because it's identical to the development cycle.

## It's About Habit, Not Platform

In the end, blog failure isn't a platform problem — it's a habit problem.

No matter which platform you use, the key is writing consistently. Don't aim for perfect posts. Write short, write often. And stick with wherever you've chosen. No more moving.

I'm genuinely going to write regularly this time. Of course, I've made this promise every time... but this time it's for real. Probably. Maybe.
