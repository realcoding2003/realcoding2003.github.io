# Building a GitHub Pages Tech Blog with AI (2) - Complete Automation of SEO-Optimized Tech Posting with MCP

![Hero Image](/assets/images/posts/mcp-automated-blog-posting/hero.png)

## 🎯 Key Summary
**Existing Problem**: Separate handling of content writing, SEO optimization, and image generation when writing tech posts
**MCP Solution**: Just provide a post idea and automatically generate complete markdown file with SEO optimization

```bash
# What MCP generates with single command
├── 2025-06-09-react-hooks-optimization.md  # Complete post
├── /assets/images/posts/react-hooks/       # Optimized images
└── SEO metadata                             # Automatically optimized
```

## 🚀 Post Automation Workflow

### Traditional vs MCP Approach

**Traditional Manual Process** (2-3 hours):
1. Topic research and structure planning
2. Markdown file creation and metadata writing
3. Content writing and code example preparation
4. Image generation or search
5. SEO optimization and tag setup

**MCP Automation Process** (10 minutes):
1. Present idea
2. Complete post file generation
3. Review and fine-tuning
